Hello, everyone
My name is Mauricio Dimate
The process of the webpage was difficult because I had a lot of problems to code, the case of the galleries took a lot of time, and  I spent hours on the way all the images should be responsive. Also, the padding in some cases are stressful, likewise the mock-up sometimes  I canÂ´t be exactly because My code is not the best to reply like equal, but I try.

Another thing is I would like to apply different effects of javascript and create like a web page with a lot of functionality, so I need to learn properly javascript, I did not use in my code because I waste a lot of time trying to learn the code was incorrect, so I decided did not use, yeah I had other issues with this web page. Also, I feel very anxious about this project, because my marks are not the best and I need to get a job. 

The experience of this assignment is good because of the stress and the situation, help you to improve in the professional aspect.
